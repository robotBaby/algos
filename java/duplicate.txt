Jack and Jill went up the hill, 
To fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown, 
And Jill came tumbling after.

Up Jack got and home he ran, 
As fast as he could caper. 
There his mother bound his head, 
With vinegar and brown paper. 

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, 
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall; 
All the King's horses and all the King's men, 
Couldn't put Humpty together again.

Rock a bye baby, on the tree top,
When the wind blows the cradle will rock.
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,
And mumma will catch you, cradle and all.
